CUDA-MPI scratchpad.

Environment:
* mvapich2 >= 1.7 & CRAY MPI
* CUDA >= 3.2
* PBS and SLURM
* Linux clusters and Cray XK6
* Tesla M2090 and X2090

Compilation
-----------

The best option is to use CMake since it works nicely with CUDA and MPI and will automatically have nvcc use the proper mpi compiler wrapper.

Another option is to simply specify all the include and library paths as well as all the libraries on the nvcc command line.
